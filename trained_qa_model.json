This syntax can also be broken down into simpler components where expression can be any operation (e.g. x**2), item can be any element of the list (e.g., x), iterable can be any list or data that Python can iterate over (e.g. range(10)),  and condition is an optional test that must be passed in order to include the value in the list.",
